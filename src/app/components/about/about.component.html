        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.
        The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe
        cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your
        face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.</div>

      <div class="message-body">
        Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also
        spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or
        mouth.</div>

      <div class="message-body">
        You can protect yourself and help prevent spreading the virus to others if you:
        Do
        Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
        Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
        Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
        Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
        Don't
        Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean
